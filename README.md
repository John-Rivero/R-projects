This project is about analyzing the financial performance of a company by calculating various metrics such as profit, profit after tax, profit margin, good months, bad months, best month, and worst month. The data used for this analysis includes monthly revenue and monthly expenses of the company for a financial year, and the tax rate is assumed to be 30%. The task requires a data scientist to use their skills in financial analysis and programming to provide insights on the company's financial statement.
