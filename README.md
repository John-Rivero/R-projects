## [1. Financial Statement Analysis](https://github.com/John-Rivero/R-projects/tree/main/1.%20Financial%20Statement%20Analysis)


This project is about analyzing the financial performance of a company by calculating various metrics such as profit, profit after tax, profit margin, good months, bad months, best month, and worst month. The data used for this analysis includes monthly revenue and monthly expenses of the company for a financial year, and the tax rate is assumed to be 30%. The task requires a data scientist to use their skills in financial analysis and programming to provide insights on the company's financial statement.


## [2. Basketball Freethrows Analysis](https://github.com/John-Rivero/R-projects/tree/main/2.%20Basketball%20Freethrows%20Analysis)


This project uses R programming language to create three plots that depict the insights obtained from two additional basketball in-game statistics: Free Throws and Free Throw Attempts. The plots show the average free throw attempts made per game, accuracy of free throws made by players, and player's preference for 2-point and 3-point shots, excluding free throws. The data is in the form of vectors that will be converted into matrices before analysis.
